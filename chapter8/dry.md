# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

## Possible duplicated items

1. Saying that the dog door should alert the owner when it finds a blocking element for opening the door and also saying that the dog door can be integrated into the house's overall alarm system.
2. Indicating that for internal blockage we'll use the alarm but for external blockage the door has to do a noise.

## Reformulating

1. The dog door should work only during certain hours of the day.
2. The dog door should be connected to the house's alarm system to trigger some signals.
3. The dog door should be able to detect when there is an object blocking its movement inside/outside.
4. The dog door should signal to the alarm system when it detects a blocking object.
5. The dog door should keep the count of how many times the dog enters and leaves the house.
